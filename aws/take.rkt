(provide in-take)

;; Background: Functions like `hash', `hash-set*', `dict-set*' and so
;; on take argument couples as alternating arguments rather than a
;; cons pair. Using such functions can be refreshing, as you can type
;; simply (hash k0 v0 k1 v1) instead of all the dots and parens with
;; #hash([k0 . v0][k1 v2]).
;;
;; Using such functions is nice, but defining them is a bit awkward --
;; unless you have in-take.  It lets you sequence a flat list of items
;; in groups of N, much like using `take' and `drop'.
;;
;; Likewise, this makes it easy to write simple flat wrappers. For example
;; here is a `hash'-like initializer for association lists:
;;
;; (define (alist . xs)
;;   (for/list ([(k v) (in-take xs 2)])
;;     (cons k v)))
;;
;; Generalizing:
;;
;; 1. At first I wrote this for couples in lists.
;;
;; 2. Then I generalized it to any group size -- couples, triples,
;; whatever -- in lists.
;;
;; 3. Then I generalized it to any single-valued sequence: list,
;; vector, string, etc.

;; (in-take seq n fill) is a way to take `n' elements at a time from
;; `seq'. For instance with n=2 you will get successive couples of
;; elements, with n=3 you get triples, and so on.  `n' defaults to 2.
;; If there aren't exactly `n' elements at the end of the list, `fill'
;; is called with an index from 0 to (sub1 n). `fill' defaults to a
;; procedure that raises an error, but you may supply a procedure that
;; "fills in missing values".
;;
;; Note: Just as I was finishing this, I discovered `in-slice' in
;; racket/unstable. Although that's great as far as it goes, I've
;; found that my optional `fill' functionality to handle missing
;; values is very useful.
